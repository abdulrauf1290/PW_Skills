    "Here are some of the advantages of using Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Lightweight and Minimalistic: Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalistic design. It doesn't impose any particular project structure or dependencies, allowing developers to have greater flexibility in organizing their code and choosing the components they need.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Easy to Get Started: Flask has a gentle learning curve, making it an excellent choice for beginners. The framework provides a straightforward API that is intuitive to understand and work with. It encourages writing clean and readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Flexibility: Flask gives developers the freedom to make decisions about the project structure, database, template engine, and other components. It doesn't enforce any specific choices, allowing developers to use the tools and libraries they prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Extensibility: Flask is highly extensible and allows developers to add functionality through its extensive ecosystem of extensions. These extensions provide additional features such as authentication, database integration, form validation, and more, making it easy to enhance the capabilities of your application."
