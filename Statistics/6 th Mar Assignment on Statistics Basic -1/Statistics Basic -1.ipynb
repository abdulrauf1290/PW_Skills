    "Nominal Data: Nominal data represents categories or groups that have no intrinsic order or ranking. It involves qualitative distinctions, and the data points are typically labels or names. Examples include gender (male, female), eye color (blue, brown, green), or country of origin (USA, UK, Canada).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Ordinal data also represents categories, but they have a specific order or ranking associated with them. The intervals between the categories may not be uniform. Examples include survey ratings like 1-5 scale satisfaction levels (1 = very dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied) or education levels (e.g., elementary, middle, high school, college).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Data: Interval data represents numeric or continuous values with equal intervals between them, but there is no true zero point. Arithmetic operations such as addition and subtraction can be performed on interval data. Examples include temperature measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit, or years (e.g., 1990, 2000, 2010).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Data: Ratio data is similar to interval data, but it has a true zero point, representing the absence of the measured quantity. This type of data allows for all arithmetic operations, including multiplication and division. Examples include weight, height, or time taken to complete a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete Data: Discrete data consists of whole numbers or countable values that have distinct separations. These values typically result from counting or enumerating. Examples include the number of students in a class, the number of cars in a parking lot, or the number of goals scored in a soccer match.\n",
