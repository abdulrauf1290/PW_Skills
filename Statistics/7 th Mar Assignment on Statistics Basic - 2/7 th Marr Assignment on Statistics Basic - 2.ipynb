    "The mean, median, and mode are different measures of central tendency used to describe the typical or central value of a dataset. Here's an explanation of their differences and how they are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is calculated by summing up all the values in a dataset and dividing the sum by the total number of values. It represents the average value of the dataset. The mean is commonly used and provides a balance between all the values in the dataset. However, it is sensitive to extreme values, also known as outliers. Even a single outlier can significantly affect the mean, pulling it towards the extreme value. The mean is useful when the data is normally distributed or symmetrically distributed around a central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. It is not affected by extreme values or outliers since it is only concerned with the position of the values. The median is useful when the data contains outliers or when the distribution is skewed. Skewness refers to the asymmetry of the dataset, where the tail of the distribution is elongated in one direction. The median provides a more robust measure of central tendency in such cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the value or values that occur most frequently in a dataset. It represents the peak(s) or the most common value(s) in the dataset. Unlike the mean and median, the mode can be used with categorical or discrete data, as well as with numerical data. The mode is useful for identifying the most frequent category or value in a dataset. It is particularly helpful when dealing with qualitative or nominal data, such as colors, types of cars, or survey responses."
